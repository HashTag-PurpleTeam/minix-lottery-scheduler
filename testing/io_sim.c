/* io_sim.c
 * 
 * A program that simulates an IO bound process.
 * 
 * From assignment specs: "A second test program should open a file,
 * add up every byte into a checksum, then save the input data back
 * into a new copy of the file and print out the checksum (reading and
 * writing blocks of 1024 bytes). This test program simulates an IO
 * bound process with some minor CPU use."
